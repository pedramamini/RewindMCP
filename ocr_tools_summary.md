# New OCR Tools Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully added 4 new MCP tools to provide comprehensive OCR content access from time windows, addressing the gap where users could only search for specific keywords but not pull all OCR content from a time frame. The tools now return actual OCR text content instead of just metadata about frames and nodes.

## New Tools Added

### 1. `get_screen_ocr_relative`
**Purpose**: Get all screen OCR content from a relative time period
**Parameters**:
- `time_period` (required): Time period like '1hour', '30minutes', '1day', '1week'
- `application` (optional): Filter results by application name

**Use Case**: "Show me all screen content from the last 2 hours" or "Show me all Chrome content from the last day"

### 2. `get_screen_ocr_absolute`
**Purpose**: Get all screen OCR content from a specific time window
**Parameters**:
- `from` (required): Start time in ISO format
- `to` (required): End time in ISO format
- `timezone` (optional): Timezone if not specified in from/to times
- `application` (optional): Filter results by application name

**Use Case**: "Show me all screen content from my 3 PM meeting" or "Show me all Slack content from yesterday afternoon"

### 3. `get_ocr_applications_relative`
**Purpose**: Discover all applications that have OCR data from a relative time period
**Parameters**:
- `time_period` (required): Time period like '1hour', '30minutes', '1day', '1week'

**Use Case**: "What applications were active in the last 4 hours?" - helps users discover what apps to filter by

### 4. `get_ocr_applications_absolute`
**Purpose**: Discover all applications that have OCR data from a specific time window
**Parameters**:
- `from` (required): Start time in ISO format
- `to` (required): End time in ISO format
- `timezone` (optional): Timezone if not specified in from/to times

**Use Case**: "What applications were active during my meeting from 2-3 PM?" - helps users discover what apps to filter by

## Workflow Integration

The tools work together in a natural workflow:

1. **Discovery Phase**: Use `get_ocr_applications_*` to see what applications were active
   ```
   get_ocr_applications_relative: "2hours"
   → Returns: Chrome, Slack, VS Code, Zoom, etc.
   ```

2. **Focused Retrieval**: Use `get_screen_ocr_*` with application filter to get specific content
   ```
   get_screen_ocr_relative: time_period="2hours", application="Chrome"
   → Returns: All Chrome OCR content from last 2 hours
   ```

3. **Keyword Search**: Use existing `search_screen_ocr` for specific content within results
   ```
   search_screen_ocr: keyword="meeting notes", application="Slack"
   → Returns: Specific matches for "meeting notes" in Slack
   ```

## Key Features

### Application Filtering
Both OCR content tools support optional application filtering:
- Without filter: Returns all OCR content from all applications
- With filter: Returns only OCR content from the specified application
- Case-insensitive matching (e.g., "chrome" matches "Google Chrome")

### Rich Metadata
The application discovery tools provide:
- Frame count per application
- OCR node count (activity level)
- Number of unique windows
- Time range when application was active
- Sorted by activity level (most active first)

### Consistent Time Handling
All tools use the same smart datetime parsing:
- Support for relative time periods ("2hours", "1day", etc.)
- Support for absolute time ranges with timezone handling
- Consistent with existing transcript tools

## Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- Added new `get_screen_ocr_text_absolute()` and `get_screen_ocr_text_relative()` methods to RewindDB
- Uses `searchRanking_content` table to retrieve actual OCR text content (c0 column)
- Efficient querying with proper time range filtering and text extraction

### Response Format
- OCR content tools: Shows actual OCR text content grouped by frame, not just metadata
- Application discovery tools: Shows text-based statistics (text records, average text length)
- Hides technical concepts like "nodes" from users - focuses on readable content
- Consistent error handling and user guidance

### Error Handling
- Validates time period formats
- Provides helpful suggestions when no data found
- Graceful handling of missing applications or time ranges

## Benefits

1. **Complete OCR Access**: Users can now pull all screen content from any time window
2. **Application Discovery**: Easy way to see what apps were active during specific periods
3. **Flexible Filtering**: Can focus on specific applications after discovery
4. **Meeting Analysis**: Perfect for reviewing what was displayed during meetings
5. **Work Session Review**: Analyze screen activity during work periods
6. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing search and transcript tools

This implementation fills the critical gap in MCP OCR functionality while maintaining consistency with existing tools and providing a natural workflow for users.
